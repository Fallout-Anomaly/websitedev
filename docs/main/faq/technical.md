# Display & Technical Fixes

<TerminalCard title="Resolution & Hardware Fixes">

### Screen is in the upper left corner
This is usually a resolution mismatch or third-party overlay conflict.
1.  **Fallen World Launcher:** Rerun the launcher and ensure your native resolution is selected.
2.  **Disable Overlays:** Turn off Steam, Discord, and Medal overlays.
3.  **DPI Scaling:** Right-click `Fallout4.exe` in your Stock folder → Properties → Compatibility → Change High DPI settings → Enable **High DPI Scaling Override** (Set to Application).

### Ultrawide HUD adjustment
If your HUD feels off-center on 21:9 or 32:9 monitors:
1.  Open **MCM** → **FallUI HUD**.
2.  Use the **Layout Editor** to manually reposition widgets.
3.  Alternatively, use our [optimized ultrawide layout](/FallUIHUD-Layout-Export.ini).

### NVIDIA Performance Issues
If your FPS is locked low or stuttering:
*   Disable **NVIDIA Reflex**, **Smooth Motion**, and **Low Latency** in the NVIDIA Control Panel game settings for Fallout 4. The modlist has its own internal optimizations that conflict with these external settings.
